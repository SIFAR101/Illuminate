Illuminate is an app that improves the beauty shopping experience for visually-impaired persons where we bring product information to a user’s device where they can better read or listen to it. We took a particular interest in Sephora boutiques as there are [some useful APIs](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/sephora) that make the type of accessibility in our app possible. We'd like to thank Rapid API and API Dojo for making this possible.
